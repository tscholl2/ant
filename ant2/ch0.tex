\chapter{Preface}

This book is based on notes for a one-semester
undergraduate course on Algebraic Number Theory, which the author
taught at Harvard during Spring 2004 and Spring 2005, then at UCSD
and at University of Washington many times as a graduate course.
This book was mainly inspired by the \cite[Ch.~1]{sd:brief} and
Cassels's article {\em Global Fields} in \cite{cassels:global}.
Travis Scholl also very carefully read the entire book and made
numerous improvements throughout as part of a
reading course in 2015.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This book closely builds on
Swinnerton-Dyer's book \cite{sd:brief} and Cassels's article
\cite{cassels:global}. Many of the students of Math 129 at Harvard
during Spring 2004 and 2005 made helpful comments: Jennifer
Balakrishnan, Peter Behrooz, Jonathan Bloom, David Escott Jayce Getz,
Michael Hamburg, Deniz Kural, Danielle Li, Andrew Ostergaard, Gregory
Price, Grant Schoenebeck, Jennifer Sinnott, Stephen Walker, Daniel
Weissman, and Inna Zakharevich in 2004; Mauro Braunstein, Steven
Byrnes, William Fithian, Frank Kelly, Alison Miller, Nizameddin
Ordulu, Corina Patrascu, Anatoly Preygel, Emily Riehl, Gary Sivek,
Steven Sivek, Kaloyan Slavov, Gregory Valiant, and Yan Zhang in 2005.
Also the course assistants Matt Bainbridge and Andrei Jorza made many
helpful comments.  The mathematical software \cite{sage}, \cite{pari},
and \cite{magma} were used in writing this book.

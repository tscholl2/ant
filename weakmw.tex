\section{Kummer Theory of Number Fields}\label{sec:kummernf}

Suppose $K$ is a number field and fix a positive integer~$n$.
Let $\mu_n$ denote the $n$th roots of unity in $\Kbar$ as a group
under multiplication. Consider the exact sequence
$$
	1 \to \mu_n \to \Kbar^* \xrightarrow{n} \Kbar^* \to 1
$$
where $n$ denotes the map $a\mapsto a^n$.

The corresponding long exact sequence from Theorem~\ref{thm:cohomology}
is
$$
	1 \to \mu_n(K) \to K^* \xrightarrow{n} K^*
	\to \H^1(K,\mu_n) \to \H^1(K,\Kbar^*) =0,
$$
where $\mu_n(K)$ is the $n$th roots of unity contained in $K$.
The last equality follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:h90}.

Assume now that the group $\mu_n$ is contained in $K$.
Using Galois cohomology we obtain a relatively simple classification
of all abelian extensions of~$K$ with cyclic Galois group of order
dividing~$n$. Moreover, since the action of $\Gal(\Kbar/K)$ on
$\mu_n$ is trivial, by our hypothesis that $\mu_n\subset K$,
Exercise~\ref{ex:H1hom} implies
$$
	\H^1(K,\mu_n) = \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),\mu_n).
$$
Thus we obtain an exact sequence
$$
	1 \to \mu_n \to K^* \xrightarrow{n} K^*
	\to \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),\mu_n) \to 1,
$$
or equivalently, an isomorphism
$$
	K^*/(K^*)^n \isom \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),\mu_n).
$$
By Galois theory, homomorphisms $\Gal(\Kbar/K)\to \mu_n$ (up to
automorphisms of $\mu_n$) correspond to cyclic abelian extensions
of~$K$ with Galois group a subgroup of the cyclic group $\mu_n$.
Unwinding the definitions, this says that every
cyclic abelian extension of $K$ of degree dividing~$n$ is of the form
$K(a^{1/n})$ for some element $a\in K$.

One can prove via calculations that $K(a^{1/n})$ is unramified
outside $n$ and the primes that divide $\Norm(a)$.
Moreover, and this is a much bigger result, one can
combine this with facts about class groups and unit groups to prove
the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:maxunramfin}
	Suppose $K$ is a number field with $\mu_n\subset K$, where $n$
	is a positive integer. Let $L$ be the maximal extension of $K$
	such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(i)] $\Gal(L/K)$ is abelian,
		\item[(ii)] $n\cdot \Gal(L/K) = 0$, and
		\item[(iii)] $L$ is unramified outside a finite set~$S$ of primes.
	\end{enumerate}
	Then $L/K$ is of finite degree.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
	Note that we may enlarge $S$ as needed. To see this,
	choose a finite set $S' \supseteq S$ and let $L'$ the
	maximal extension with respect to $S'$ as in the
	statement of the theorem. Because $L$ is unramified
	outside of $S$, it is certainly unramified outside of
	$S'$. By maximality of $L'$ this implies $L' \subseteq L$.
	Therefore it's sufficient to show the larger extension
	$L'/K$ is finite.
	
	We first argue that we can enlarge~$S$ so that the ring
	$$
		\O_{K,S} =
			\{
			a \in K^* \colon \ord_\p(a\O_K) \geq 0 \text{ for all } \p\not\in S
			\}
			\union\{0\}
	$$
	is a principal ideal domain.
	One can show that for any~$S$, the ring $\O_{K,S}$ is a Dedekind domain.
	%TODO possible exercise?
	The condition $ \ord_\p(a\O_K) \geq 0$
	means that in the prime ideal factorization of the fractional ideal
	$a\O_K$, we have that~$\p$ occurs to a nonnegative power. Thus we are
	allowing denominators at the primes in~$S$. Since the class group of
	$\O_K$ is finite, there are primes $\p_1,\ldots, \p_r$ that generate
	the class group as a group (for example, take all primes with norm up to
	the Minkowski bound). Enlarge~$S$ to contain the primes $\p_i$.
	
	Note that we have used \emph{the class group of $\O_K$ is finite}.
	
	Next we want to show $\p_i\O_{K,S}$ is the unit ideal. To see this,
	let $m$ be the order of $\p_i$ in the class group of $\O_{K}$ so that
	$\p_i^m = (\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in \O_{K}$. Note the factorization
	of $\frac{1}{\alpha}\O_{K}$ is $\p_i^{-m}$ so by construction
	$\frac{1}{\alpha}\in\O_{K,S}.$ Since
	$\alpha\in \left(\p_i\O_{K,S}\right)^m$ this shows $(\p_i\O_{K,S})^m$
	is the unit ideal. It follows from the unique factorization of ideals
	in the Dedekind domain $\O_{K,S}$ that $\p_i\O_{K,S}$ is the unit ideal.
	
	Now we can show $\O_{K,S}$ is a principal ideal domain. Let $\P$
	be a prime ideal of $\O_{K,S}$. Since the $\p_i$ generate
	the class group of $\O_K$, the restriction of $\P$ to $\O_K$ is
	equivalent modulo a principal ideal to a product of the primes
	$\p_i$. Therefore $\P$ is equivalent modulo a principal ideal
	to a product of ideals of the form $\p_i\O_{K,S}$. Because we showed
	$\p_i\O_{K,S}$ was the unit ideal, this means $\P$ is principal.
	
	Next enlarge $S$ so that all primes over $n\O_K$ are in~$S$.
	Note that $\O_{K,S}$ is still a PID.  Let
	$$
	 K(S,n) =
	 	\{
	 	a \in K^*/(K^*)^n \colon n \mid \ord_\p(a) \text{ for all } \p\not\in S
	 	\}.
	$$
	Then a refinement of the arguments at the beginning of
	this section show that $L$ is generated by all $n$th roots
	of the elements of $K(S,n)$ (specifically, their representatives in $K$).
	Thus it suffices to prove that $K(S,n)$ is finite.
	
	If $a \in \O_{K,S}^*$ then $\ord_\p(a)=0$ for all $\p\notin S$.
	So there is a natural map
	$$
		\phi: \O_{K,S}^* \to K(S,n)
	$$
	sending $a$ to it's residue class in $K^*/(K^*)^n$.
	Suppose $a\in K^*$ is a representative of an element in $K(S,n)$.
	The ideal $a \O_{K,S}$ has a factorization which is a product of $n$th
	powers, so it is an $n$th power of an ideal. Since $\O_{K,S}$ is a PID,
	there is $b\in \O_{K,S}$ and $u\in \O_{K,S}^*$ such that
	$$
		a = b^n \cdot u.
	$$
	Thus $u\in \O_{K,S}^*$ maps to $[a] \in K(S,n)$. This shows $\phi$
	is surjective.
	
	Recall {\em Dirichlet's unit theorem} (Theorem~\ref{thm:units}),
	which asserts that the group $\O_K^*$ is a finitely generated
	abelian group of rank $r+s-1$.  More generally, we
	now show that $\O_{K,S}^*$ is a finitely generated abelian group of
	rank $r+s+\#S -1$.
	This result with above would imply $K(S,n)$ is a torsion group
	which is a quotient of a finitely generated group and hence finite,
	thus proving the theorem.
	
	\index{$S$-unit theorem}\index{Dirichlet!$S$-unit theorem}
	The fact that $\O_{K,S}^*$ has rank $r+s-1 + \#S$ is sometimes
	referred to as the \emph{$S$-unit theorem} or the
	\emph{Dirichlet $S$-unit theorem}. To prove this theorem,
	let $\p_1,\ldots, \p_m$ be the primes in~$S$
	and define a map $\phi: \O_{K,S}^* \to \Z^m$ by
	$$
		\phi(u) = (\ord_{\p_1}(u), \ldots, \ord_{\p_m}(u)).
	$$
	First we show that $\Ker(\phi) = \O_K^*$.  We have that
	$u\in \Ker(\phi)$ if and only if $u \in \O_{K,S}^*$
	and $\ord_{\p_i}(u) = 0$ for all $i$; but the latter condition
	implies that $u$ is a unit at each prime in $S$. But
	$u\in \O_{K,S}^*$ implies $\ord_{\p}(u) = 0$ for all $\p\notin S$,
	so it follows that $\ord_{\p}(u)=0$ for all primes $\p$ in $\O_K$
	and therefore $u\in \O_K^*$.
	Thus we have an exact sequence
	$$
		1 \to \O_K^* \to \O_{K,S}^* \xrightarrow{\phi} \Z^m.
	$$
	Next we show that the image of $\phi$ has finite index
	in $\Z^m$.  Let $h$ be the class number of $\O_K$.
	For each $i$ there exists $\alpha_i \in \O_K$
	such that $\p_i^h = (\alpha_i)$.  But $\alpha_i \in \O_{K,S}^*$
	since $\ord_{\p}(\alpha_i) = 0$ for all $\p\not\in S$ (by unique
	factorization). Then
	$$
		\phi(\alpha_i) = (0,\ldots, 0, h, 0,\ldots, 0).
	$$
	It follows that $(h\Z)^m \subset \Im(\phi)$, so
	the image of $\phi$ has finite index in $\Z^m$.  It follows
	that $\O_{K,S}^*$ has rank equal to $r+s-1+\#S$.

\section{Proof of the Weak Mordell-Weil Theorem}
Suppose $E$ is an elliptic curve over a number field~$K$, and
fix a positive integer~$n$.
Just as with number fields, we have an exact sequence
$$
	0 \to E[n] \to E \xra{n} E \to 0.
$$
Then we have an exact sequence
$$
	0 \to E[n](K) \to E(K) \xra{n} E(K) \to \H^1(K,E[n]) \to \H^1(K,E)[n] \to 0.
$$
Note the last term comes from replacing the codomain of
$\H^1(K,E[n]) \to \H^1(K,E)$ by the kernel of $\H^1(K,E) \xra{n} \H^1(K,E)$.
From this we obtain a short exact sequence
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ke1}
	0 \to E(K)/n E(K) \to \H^1(K,E[n]) \to \H^1(K,E)[n] \to 0.
\end{equation}

Now assume, in analogy with Section~\ref{sec:kummernf}, that
$E[n]\subset E(K)$, i.e., all $n$-torsion points are defined over~$K$.
Then the Galois action on $E[n]$ is trivial so by
exercise~\ref{ex:H1hom} we have
$$
	\H^1(K,E[n]) = \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),E[n]) \cong %TODO non-canonical iso
	\Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),(\Z/n\Z)^2),
$$
and the sequence (\ref{eqn:ke1}) induces an inclusion
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:injmw}
	E(K)/n E(K) \hookrightarrow \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),(\Z/n\Z)^2).
\end{equation}

Explicitly, this homomorphism sends a point $P$ to the homomorphism
defined as follows: Choose $Q \in E(\Kbar)$ such that $nQ = P$; then
send each $\sigma \in \Gal(\Kbar/K)$ to $\sigma(Q)-Q\in E[n]$.

\begin{exercise}
	Consider the map $E(K) \to \Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K),E[n])$ defined above.
	First show this map is well defined, i.e., $\sigma(Q) - Q \in E[n]$.
	Then show it does not depend on the choice of $P$ modulo $nE(K)$
	so it in fact descends to a homomorphism on $E(K)/nE(K)$.
\end{exercise}

Because $E[n] \isom (\Z/n\Z)^2$, %TODO non-canonical iso
given a point $P\in E(K)$, we obtain a homomorphism
$\vphi : \Gal(\Kbar/K) \to (\Z/n\Z)^2$, whose kernel defines an
abelian extension~$L$ of $K$ that has exponent~$n$.
The amazing fact is that $L$ can be ramified only at the primes
of bad reduction for $E$ and the primes that divide~$n$.
Thus we can apply theorem~\ref{thm:maxunramfin} to see that there are
only finitely many such~$L$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:mwunram}
	If $P\in E(K)$ is a point, then the field~$L$ obtained by adjoining to $K$
	all coordinates of all choices of $Q=\frac{1}{n}P$ is unramified
	outside $n$ and the primes of bad reduction for~$E$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
	First one proves that if $\p \nmid n$ is a prime of good reduction
	for~$E$, then the natural reduction map $\pi: E(K)[n] \to
	\tilde{E}(\O_K/\p)$ is injective.  The argument that~$\pi$ is
	injective uses \emph{formal groups}, whose development is outside the
	scope of this course.\footnote{For an introduction to
	formal groups of elliptic curves see \cite[Ch. IV]{silverman:aec}.}
	Next fix any $Q$ as in the statement of the theorem.
	Above we saw $\sigma(Q)-Q \in E[n]$ for
	all $\sigma \in \Gal(\Kbar/K)$.  Let $I_\p\subset \Gal(L/K)$ be the
	inertia group at $\p$. By definition of interia group, $I_\p$
	acts trivially on $\tilde{E}(\O_K/\p)$.  Thus for each $\sigma \in
	I_\p$ we have
	$$
		\pi(\sigma(Q) - Q) = \sigma(\pi(Q)) - \pi(Q) = \pi(Q) - \pi(Q) = 0.
	$$
	Since $\pi$ is injective, it follows that $\sigma(Q) = Q$ for $\sigma\in I_\p$,
	i.e., that $Q$ is fixed under all $I_\p$.
	Repeating for all $Q$ this shows $I_\p = 1$ so $L$ is unramified
	at $\p$.

	%TODO weave this into the proof following Silverman or
	%TODO reword \pi ?
	Note that we technically only defined $\pi$ on $E(K)[n]$ and
	$\sigma(Q)-Q$ may not lie in $E(K)$. However, given a finite
	extension $K'/K$ and prime $\p'$ lying over $\p$, $E$ the
	reduction map $E(K') \to \tilde{E}(\O_{K'}/{\p'})$ is still injective.
	So we could apply the argument to the field $K'$ given by adjoining
	the coordinates of $Q$ to $K$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Weak Mordell-Weil]\label{thm:weakMW}
	Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field~$K$, and
	let $n$ be any positive integer.  Then
	$E(K)/nE(K)$ is finitely generated.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	First suppose all elements of $E[n]$ have coordinates in~$K$.  Then
	the homomorphism (\ref{eqn:injmw}) provides an injection of $E(K)/n
	E(K)$ into
	$$
		\Hom(\Gal(\Kbar/K), (\Z/n\Z)^2).
	$$
	By Theorem~\ref{thm:mwunram}, the image consists of homomorphisms whose
	kernels cut out an abelian extension of~$K$ unramified outside $n$
	and primes of bad reduction for~$E$.  Since this is a finite set of
	primes, Theorem~\ref{thm:maxunramfin} implies that the homomorphisms
	all factor through a finite quotient $\Gal(L/K)$ of $\Gal(\Qbar/K)$.
	Thus there can be only finitely many such homomorphisms, so the
	image of $E(K)/nE(K)$ is finite.  Thus $E(K)/nE(K)$ itself is
	finite, which proves the theorem in this case.
	
	Next suppose~$E$ is an elliptic curve over a number field, but do {\em
	not} make the hypothesis that the elements of $E[n]$ have
	coordinates in~$K$.  Since the group $E[n](\C)$ is finite and its
	elements are defined over~$\Qbar$, the extension~$L$ of~$K$ got by
	adjoining to~$K$ all coordinates of elements of $E[n](\C)$ is a finite
	extension.  It is also Galois, as we saw when constructing Galois
	representations attached to elliptic curves.
	By Proposition~\ref{prop:infres}, we have an exact sequence
	$$
		0 \to \H^1(L/K, E[n](L))\to   \H^1(K,E[n])\to \H^1(L,E[n]).
	$$
	The kernel of the restriction map
	$\H^1(K,E[n])\to \H^1(L,E[n])$ is finite, since it is
	isomorphic to the finite cohomology group
	$\H^1(L/K, E[n](L))$.  By the argument of the previous
	paragraph, the image of $E(K)/nE(K)$ in $\H^1(L,E[n])$
	under
	$$
		E(K)/n E(K) \hra \H^1(K,E[n]) \xra{\res} \H^1(L,E[n])
	$$
	is finite, since it is contained in the image of $E(L)/n E(L)$.
	Thus $E(K)/n E(K)$ is finite, since we just proved
	the kernel of $\res$ is finite.
\end{proof}
